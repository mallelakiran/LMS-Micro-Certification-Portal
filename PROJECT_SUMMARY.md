# LMS Micro-Certification Portal - Project Summary

## üìã Project Overview

The LMS Micro-Certification Portal is a complete web application that allows students to take interactive quizzes and earn digital certificates. The project demonstrates a full-stack implementation with modern technologies and best practices.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Frontend (React Application)
**Location:** `/frontend/`
- **Framework:** React 18 with functional components and hooks
- **Routing:** React Router DOM for navigation
- **State Management:** React Context API for authentication
- **Styling:** Modern CSS with responsive design
- **HTTP Client:** Axios for API communication

**Key Components:**
- `AuthContext.js` - Global authentication state management
- `ProtectedRoute.js` - Route protection for authenticated users
- `Login.js` / `Register.js` - User authentication forms
- `Dashboard.js` - Main quiz selection interface
- `Quiz.js` - Interactive quiz taking interface with timer
- `Results.js` - Quiz results display and certificate download
- `MyResults.js` - User's quiz history and certificate management

### Backend (Node.js/Express API)
**Location:** `/backend/`
- **Framework:** Express.js with RESTful API design
- **Database:** MySQL with mysql2 driver
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Security:** bcryptjs for password hashing, CORS middleware
- **File Generation:** PDFKit for certificate creation
- **Validation:** express-validator for input validation

**API Structure:**
- `routes/auth.js` - User registration, login, profile management
- `routes/quiz.js` - Quiz data retrieval, submission, scoring
- `routes/certificate.js` - PDF certificate generation and download
- `middleware/auth.js` - JWT token verification middleware

### Database (MySQL)
**Location:** `/backend/database/schema.sql`

**Tables:**
1. **users** - User accounts (id, name, email, password, timestamps)
2. **quizzes** - Quiz metadata (id, title, description, passing_score, time_limit)
3. **questions** - Quiz questions (id, quiz_id, question_text, options, correct_answer)
4. **results** - Quiz attempts (id, user_id, quiz_id, score, percentage, passed, answers)
